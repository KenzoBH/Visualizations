# Visualizations
Repo that contains nice data visualizations.  
this repository is intended to contain beautiful data visualizations, which I do to develop my skills.  
The plots shown here are made in R and in Python, using:

- R: ggplot2 (which I prefer over Python :p)
- Python: matplotlib, seaborn

There are two folders here: [Visualizations](Visualizations) - that contains the image files -, and [Scripts](Scripts) - that contains the .R and .py files that I used to generate the plots.
